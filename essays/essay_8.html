	<h1>Essay 8<br> ( November 30 - December 6 )</h1>
    <p>This fourth week of the second phase "Building something from scratch" I learned about Idioms, these are phrases than can not be translated literally, they have different meanings and are useful in certain situations, those phrases I learned them in my English class, also I made a test for discover my personality, I took this quiz before quarantine and I received a different personality, this time I fit in <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/es/personalidad-enfp">ENFP-T or campaigner</a>, this discover was interesting because I do not feel the same Daniel that I was when I joined to the apprentice and even I do not feel the same me of before quarantine, so discover this new description of my personality helps me to learn who I am today and understand what happened to become who I am now.</p>
    <p>In the slack channel "alorithms" one folk purpose to do <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of code</a> challenge, this 25 days challenge, where every day you need to solve a new problem and if you solved it correctly, a second one is unlock, which is a bit harder, so I started this chllenge but I am not only learning how to solve these problems, also I am learing a new programming language <a href="https://go.dev/">"Go"</a>, I was so excited to learn this tech some time ago, so this is the perfect time to learn it, also I loved the way go handle errors, so I tried to implement this philosophy in our project of BSFS</p>
    <p>Talking about our project, I learned a new way or a new technologie for document your API's, <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> is a beautiful way for formatting and automate your API documentation, there are a lot of ways of implementing this, you can use the cloud A.K.A. Swagger Hub or you can integrate it to you project, in the client or even on the server side, at the beggining I used cloud but later I learned how to integrate it in our stack (Node.js and Express.js) and now it is served in one route (www.host.com/documentation)</p>
    <p>And talking about API's routes hahaha I read an article about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/">REST API Best Practices</a> where I noticed that I have been doing a good job with naming but I can improve with my status codes, SSL certification and versioning, also I finally undestood the meaning of REST vs API vs RESTFUL is a stuff about names but its importan notice the difference of architectural phylosofy vs Concept definition vs web implementation (consecutively)</p>
    <p>Also I read the oficial documentation of <a href="https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/build-images/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/">Node.js</a> for Dockerizing apps, so I learned about the Docker images for Node.js and Express.js, some friends recommended to me Alpine but the official image of Node.js LTS (version 16.0.1) fit perfect into our project</p>
    <p>Finally I watched a series of videos about agile practices and I undesrtood the importance and how to do pair programming, CI, DS or frecuent small releases, </p>
    <p>Maybe I should watched these videos before in the week 1 of BSFS to make mor accurate our workflow but now I understand what I have done wrong and I can fix it in futures iterations using agile practices</p>
