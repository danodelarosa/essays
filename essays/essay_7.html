	<h1>Essay 7<br> ( November 23 - November 29 )</h1>
	<p>In this third week of the second phase of "Building Something from scratch" I learned a lot of things, first things first, as I mentioned in the past essay my team moved from python/flask to node.js/express.js, so I faced a new philosophy of viewing the backend programming, Node.js is event-driven this means that there is only one thread and all other events occur asynchronously, so JS has something named callback (anonymous functions that have 1st order ruling) for handling this stuff, but is horrible because you can make a mess (callback hell) easy, then in next versions of ECMAScript they introduced promises, that try to make more handlable the asynchronism in other future versions async-await features were introduced, this try to make easier promises (syntactic sugar)</p>
	<p>After learning this I learned how to avoid Injection attacks, you can face this problem in other programming languages like python, but with Node.js is more common, or at least you can confuse backend code with frontend code, so to avoid injection attacks or at least injection JS scripts you need to flat all your inputs, scape special characters, then I faced another vulnerability, CORS is automatic in web apps, so you need to specify who can access to your backend and even with authorized clients, you should create access keys yo reduce this kind of attacks</p>
	<p>While developing our API, I was thinking modular but thanks to my mentor I learned how to have a better organization in my code with models, controllers, services, and other stuff to try to keep more modular and with more readability our code, also I read an article about <a href="https://dev.to/santypk4/bulletproof-node-js-project-architecture-4epf" target="_blank">bullet proof architecture in Node.js</a> that tries to use an orthogonal architecture that is trying to keep all modular, also talking about scalability I listened to a podcast about stateless and horizontal/vertical scalability</p>
	<p>For keeping more readable our code and API I learned how to use Swagger, this is a tool to document your API, is easy to implement in your code and even on the web</p>
	<p>I watched a video named <a href="https://youtu.be/L3QkaS249Bc" target="_blank">How do we heal medicine?</a> this taught me that I can not learn everything, is impossible, but I can do my best learning about my fails, working in a team and trying to prepare myself to fail and having success even with problems or at least having fewer hits</p>
	<p>Finally I solved a problem with my teammates, someone made a marge and there was a merge conflict but even with that conflict they pushed the code to the server, the problems was that the files affected were package.json and package-lock.json, the first one is a file where dependencies are specified and the second one is a history file that is created about the first one, after reading a lot, we lose some progress but we solved this problem recreating this fil, based in our current configuration file</p>

	<p>This week was full of technical problems, I felt like a firefighter putting out fires, was exciting because I learned a lot, but I do not want to lie, I was scared sometimes, but I did my best learning and having a good mood</p>
