	<h1>Essay 9<br> ( December 7 - December 13 )</h1>
    <p>Did you remember the project where I was working? well it failed, This issue was not a technical problem, was a bit more complicated, let me explain you, When I started to meet to my client I saw him like boss, also since day 1 here at Encora I saw in the same way to the staff and it is normal (I guess), this means that I build a invisible wall between me and all the people that had more experience than me or even that is older, this was awful because it works in the school or in any other hierarchical structure, but at Encore I learned by the difficult way, everyone here is your teammate and is available to help you to acomplish your goals, well but this was a blocker to finish the project and even to started it, a client is not a boss monster, is a memeber of your to team, and he or she will help the team to see if the project is not in the wrong way, in our project the main goal was having a merging function for comparing texts, but We did not understand that (we understood another goal as the main goal) and this happend thanks to see the client and staff as an opponent, whom you have to fight for achieve any new feature, this sounds super rude but are only examples, my main idea to explain to you is that I had a communication blocker, instead of asking for validate ideas I assumed a lot of stuff and this is ok for tasks where there are not a lot of information available but if you have a person who can solve all this dubts why not asking to him or her? I was not afraid to ask (well yes, but just a little bit), I had this invisible wall to see others on a different level, this stop me to ask and I will not justify my behavior but I learned during this phase and project that I do not need to fight against my problems alone, I did not know how to ask for help and this same attitude build part of the wall because I was thinking that all my assumptions were well because is "logic" and everyone "think the same" oh boy! I was so wrong, also I did not ask because I was thinking that all my questions are googled just I do not know how to google them, but there is another thing that I learned thanks to this fail "if you fall behind, you delay your entire team, not just you" so any blocker is a team blocker and in the same way that you are happy to help, there is another teammate than will be happy to help you, there are more lessons about this project or phase but the more remarkable where those, working as a team is more about how to communicate ideas instead of knowing some technical stuff</p>
    <p>Well this fail give us a consequence and this was having a super express project similar to BSFS and was in only 3.5 days create a <a href="https://github.com/MrQuadBit/ledger" target="_blank">Simple implementation</a> of <a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/" target="_blank">ledger</a>, if you do not have experience with ledger I recommend to you read <a href="https://rolfschr.github.io/gswl-book/latest.html">this</a> also you can check my <a href="https://github.com/MrQuadBit/ledger">GitHub</a> where is the source code of this project but the big picture is "This is CLI (command-line tool) for double-entry accounting", I can explain to you how I implemented this but if you want to read that go to my GitHub but what I want to share with you is what I learned from my past failures and what do I think I did for solving my communication blockers</p>
    <p>First things first I started to communicate more with my mentors: doubts, tips and questions e.g. How do you see this? What did you do when you were an apprentice? What will you do if you were in my position? What is your approach to this problem? and stuff like that, the second is I tried to see the staff as part of the development team asking about my assumptions and how is my perspective of the situation and what is right o not, this time I had no team but I talk with my ex-teammates (that were doing the same experiment) and asking for what did they understood, what are their questions and try to solve with no assumptions, learning from their questions, besides that, this time the time was a big problem because the goal was very high and the time to short so I did my best learning as fast as possible and implement the core functions (learning what is the main goal) and validating this with the staff</p>
    <p>So this was a hard week, was full of knowledge but I learned a lot of stuff that I did not know that was related to the Software Engineer pathway, so this learning I took it for my entire career</p>
