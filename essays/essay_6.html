	<h1>Essay 6<br> ( November 16 - November 22 )</h1>
	<p>During this second week of the second phase I received a talk about "The art of feedback" and this was very interesting and helpful for me because I did not feel comfortable receiving feedback and during all these past phases I received a lot of comments, I had learned some things in the road, but in this talk a learned some tips to face these feelings and not only how to receive, even how to give a useful feedback</p>
	<p>Receiving feedback:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not wait until the bomb explodes, ask for feedback regularly</li>
		<li>Do not make it personal</li>
		<li>Make sure the feedback, expectations and consequences are clear</li>
		<li>Do not respond just by justifying your self, instead respond with a reflection</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Giving feedback:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not delay and make things worse</li>
		<li>Be empathic</li>
		<li>be clear about feedback, expectations and consequences</li>
		<li>Do not be nice, be helpful</li>
		<li>Make the person fell safe</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Feedback is about the actions, not about the persons, because actions can be changed</strong></p>

	<p>Also I received an English pronunciation class, I did not know the main differences between "ed" pronunciation in regular past tense verbs but basically are 3 differents pronunciations "id", "d" and "t" (needed, cleaned, worked)</p>

	<p>With more technical stuff, during this second week I learned JS, Node.js and express, My team took the decision to move to another tech stack for keeping simple our project, so I learned how to use these new technologies, also I had to learn how to deploy them, I used Heroku because it allows you to deploy different branches with Continous integration and not only with Main or Master, also I reviewed Vercel, but it is not the best option for this project because we just not only have a front end, also we have a REST API</p>

	<p>This week I watched a video named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKCtSzpYrs4&ab_channel=PracticalPsychology" target="_blank">Anti frigile</a> and this helped me to understand that I am here to become antifragile thanks to making mistakes and learning about them, keeping trying and improving my self every day, I will be honest, this was not an easy week, but I could keep my rhythm and I successfully finished this week doing my best and learning a lot, especially how to gain from disorder, because without chaos you can not understand the order and if you do not make mistakes, you can not learn</p>
