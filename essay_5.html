	<h1>Essay 5<br> ( November 9 - November 15 )</h1>
	<p>This 5th week I started a new phase named "Building something from scratch" the main goal is goal of making them work as a team, learn state of the art practices and tools for achieve developing goals but it is hard enough to have a high risk failure, for doing this possible the staff team assigned to us a real client, our client had a very interesting proposal <strong>"making books like we make software"</strong> the main idea is create an application where writers can have collaborative writing with more freedom than actual technological tools can give and with less messy control versioning, the first thing that I learned was:</p>
	<p><strong>Scrum</strong> is a methodology for agile software development, basically it help to do incremental development, we have sprints that is the name for a set of working time, at the start of the sprint we define our goals, every day we have a short daily meeting to communicate to the other member how you are with your tasks, at the end of the week or sprint we have a Revision sprint for giving or accepting feedback to improve the team workflow</p>
	<p>Then a friend's mentor give to us a master class about:</p>
	<p><strong>React</strong> and this with the motivation for using it in our projects, react is a library (not a framework) for frontend that has a components philosophy, where each component can be re-used, I am a backend guy but with our Team's approach of pair programming where every member in our team should do a bit of everything, I decided took this class, at firts I was a little scared because the first time that I tried React I immediately quit because was so confusing for me, but now I can see why is so popular and solve a lot of problems of traditional front end programming, with this new knowledge I am a better team mate</p>

	<p>My team decided to have 2 teams for developing our BSFS, "Team front" and "Team back", in this first sprint I started as Backend member, so I had to re-learn some topics about Python, FLASK, VENV and Docker, I realized a lot of concepts of Cloud computing at the moment of designing the architechture for this project, how important is trying to keep everything simple to do better deploy</p>

	<p>In conclusion this week a learned a lot about my mistakes, I have to improve how to make questions, how to communicate technical ideas, how to do the right questions for getting the important information without compromising sensitive one and that I have a full path for improvement and being a better me, not only in the technical aspect, I can grow my soft skills, sometimes we feel that we know how to handle some situations but is easier in theory than in practice, so I would like to practice more for avoiding that kind of thinking, this was a stressful week but with a lot of learning</p>
