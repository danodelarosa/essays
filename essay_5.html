	<h1>Essay 5<br> ( November 9 - November 15 )</h1>
	<p>This 5th week I started a new phase named "Building something from scratch" the main goal is goal of making them work as a team, learn state of the art practices and tools for achieve developing goals but it is hard enough to have a high risk failure, for doing this possible the staff team assigned to us a real client, our client had a very interesting proposal <strong>"making books like we make software"</strong> the main idea is create an application where writers can have collaborative writing with more freedom than actual technological tools can give and with less messy control versioning, the first thing that I learned was:</p>
	<p><strong>Scrum</strong> is a methodology for agile software development, basically it help to do incremental development, we have sprints that is the name for a set of working time, at the start of the sprint we define our goals, every day we have a short daily meeting to communicate to the other member how you are with your tasks, at the end of the week or sprint we have a Revision sprint for giving or accepting feedback to improve the team workflow</p>
	<p>Then a friend's mentor give to us a master class about:</p>
	<p><strong>React</strong> and this with the motivation for using it in our projects, react is a library (not a framework) that has a components philosophy, where each component can be re-used, I am a backend guy but with our approach of pair programming where every member in our team should do a bit of everything, I decided took this class, at firts I was scary because the first time that I tried React I immediately quit because was so confusing for me, but now I can see why is so popular and solve a lot of problems of traditional front end programming</p>
	

React is a library for doing frontend base in s components philosophy, where everything I a component and those can be reused

My team decide
