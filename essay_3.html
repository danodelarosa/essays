	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO5FwsblpT8&ab_channel=carlsagandotcom" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot OFFICIAL</a></strong><br>Sometimes we forget our position as humans in the universe, we think that we are so important, but we are only a dot of dust in this desert named universe, if you think in the magnitud of our world all our problems ar insignificant but hten you could remeber that we are the only planet with life, and you can start to feel so unique and maybe in that escenario, your problems are just as important as the universe itself, So enjoy your life and do your best </p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oKmb7U3H6U&ab_channel=FastCompany" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Fast Company Exclusive: Inside Google X</a></strong><br>There is a department in google named Google X lab, and the interesting here is that this plsce is for creating moonshot ideas for solving so complex problems that affects billions of people, but all this unique ideas that are see as imposibles tendo to fail a lot, but the phylosophy in X labs is "fail quickly" bacause in that way you can create new knowledge and they see their mistakes or failure as learning for improving day to day, this is an aproach taht everyone that is trying to overcome oneself needs to implement in their lifes, this what learner means, fail and then learn about your fail to create new knowledge to build new advances</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/71278954" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Bret Victor - The Future of Programming</a></strong><br>The programming started coding in binary, then some onsa said "Why not using human readable codes for the same binary operations?" and then they implement Assembly languages, then some one said "Why not using more human readable code instead of doing binary or assemblt" and then the purists said "If you do that, you will not be doing programming" and this idea delay the future of programming, programming is more than just saying what to do to a computer, is about achieve goals and solve problems with computers, and all the technological advances were made thanks to some one whi did not knowing what he was doing, someone free of dogmas like the purists, so if you can believe and live this philosphy of "I do not know what I am doing" you will become free and maybe you can start to doing new al cooler stuff</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WBeGAAYWg8&ab_channel=TalksatGoogle" class="inside-links" target="_blank">What Got You Here Won't Get You There | Marshall Goldsmith | Talks at Google:</a></strong><br>How to be a better me?

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII&ab_channel=RuiOliveira" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle</a></strong><br>When we are debugging we keep in our mind all the values that our code is doing, but have you ever think that this process can be solve with programming instead of using paper or our thoughts, well this video is not about debugging or functional programming is about that "Theres is not problem until someone has that problem" some years ago people thought that transcribing code in computers was ok or there was not problem of doing that repetitive task, but some said "Hey that is a problem" then he invented the classic copy and paste, this mindset is the new goal after becoming a Software craftsman, the next path is the way of a problem solver, this is a life style not obligatorie, you can avoid this path way, but becoming a problem solver is more than just doing stuff, is about not accepting the world you live, think about waht matters to you and what you belive, is hard because thinking aout of the box is a so strange skill but if you have it, take advantage of it.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Quantum computers explained - Limits of human technology:</a></strong><br>Roughly explained, Quantum computers are the next step in computing sciences and is important as programmers learn what is this and if this s√∫per computers become more than just an especialized tool and they become our normal computers, how to work with them, this looks like a Sci-Fi movie but is our reality, some said that programming is an essential tool that in the future everyone needs to know how to do it, but with a more complex computing like quantum computing, is possible that everyone could know about quantum computing and whats is our next goal as programmers? just wating for this revolution or prepare our selfs with quantum physics?</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE&ab_channel=Google" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab:</a></strong><br>Not only NASA is doing quantum computing, even private companies are doing quantum computers, one of this companies is google and in this video explain a bit of what means a quantum computer, it means qbits, superposition, entenglement, tunneling and even multiverses, having this power in human hands is answering questions that today do not have answers like "Are we alone in the universe?", "How is quantum physics in human size?", "There is a cure for cancer?", "There is an answer for everything?" I do not know, this makes me feel afraid that I did not be alive for that answers</p>
