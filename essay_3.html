	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO5FwsblpT8&ab_channel=carlsagandotcom" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot OFFICIAL</a></strong><br>Sometimes we forget our position as humans in the universe, we think that we are so important, but we are only a dot of dust in this desert named universe, if you think in the magnitud of our world all our problems are insignificant but then you could remeber that we are the only planet with life, and you can start to feel so unique and maybe in that escenario, your problems are just as important as the universe itself, So enjoy your life and do your best </p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oKmb7U3H6U&ab_channel=FastCompany" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Fast Company Exclusive: Inside Google X</a></strong><br>There is a department in google named Google X lab, and the interesting here is that this place is for creating moonshot ideas for solving so complex problems that affects billions of people, but all this unique ideas that are see as imposibles tend to fail a lot, but the phylosophy in X labs is "fail quickly" bacause in that way you can create new knowledge and they see their mistakes or failures as learning for improving day to day, this is an aproach for everyone that is trying to overcome oneself needs to implement in their lifes, this what being learner means, fail and then learn about your fail to create new knowledge to build new advances</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/71278954" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Bret Victor - The Future of Programming</a></strong><br>Programming started as binary code, then some one said "Why not using human readable codes for the same binary operations?" and then they implement Assembly languages, then another one said "Why not using more human readable code instead of doing binary or assembly" and then purists said "If you do that, you will not be doing programming" and this idea delay the future of programming, programming is more than just saying what to do to a computer, is about achieving goals and solving problems with computers, and all technological advances were made thanks to some one who did something while he did not know what he was doing, someone free of dogmas not like the purists, so if you can believe and live this philosphy of "I do not know what I am doing" you will become free and maybe you can start to doing new and cooler stuff</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WBeGAAYWg8&ab_channel=TalksatGoogle" class="inside-links" target="_blank">What Got You Here Won't Get You There | Marshall Goldsmith | Talks at Google:</a></strong><br>How to be a better me?

	<p>Finally figure out that you are 95 years old, What would you like to say to your younger you? What would you have liked to do? plus "Be happy now", not the next week, be happy today</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII&ab_channel=RuiOliveira" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle</a></strong><br>When we are debugging we keep in our mind all the values that our code is doing, but have you ever think that this process can be solve with programming instead of using paper or our thoughts, well this video is not about debugging or functional programming is about "Theres is not problem until someone has that problem" some years ago people thought that transcripting code in computers was ok or there was not problem of doing that repetitive task, but someone said "Hey that is a problem" then he invented the classic copy and paste, this mindset is the next goal after becoming a Software craftsman, the next goal is the problem solver pathway, this is a life style not obligatorie, you can avoid this path way, but becoming a problem solver is more than just doing stuff, is about not accepting the world you live, is thinking about what matters to you and what you belive, is hard because thinking out of the box is a so strange skill but if you have it, take advantage of it.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Quantum computers explained - Limits of human technology:</a></strong><br>Roughly explained, Quantum computers are the next step in computing sciences and is important as programmers learn what is this and if this súper computers become more than just an especialized tool and they become our normal computers, how to work with them, this looks like a Sci-Fi movie but is our reality, some said that programming is an essential tool that in the future everyone needs to know how to do it, but with a more complex computing like quantum computing, is possible that everyone could know about quantum computing and whats is our next goal as programmers? just wating for this revolution or prepare our selfs with quantum physics?</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE&ab_channel=Google" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab:</a></strong><br>Not only NASA is doing quantum computing, even private companies are doing quantum computers, one of this companies is google and in this video explain a bit of what means a quantum computer, it means qbits, superposition, entenglement, tunneling and even multiverses, having this power in human hands is answering questions that today do not have answers like "Are we alone in the universe?", "How is quantum physics in human size?", "There is a cure for cancer?", "There is an answer for everything?" I do not know, this makes me feel afraid that I did not be alive for that answers</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1YqgPAtzho&ab_channel=AngelArt" class="inside-links" target="_blank">DR. QUANTUM - DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT:</a></strong><br>Some one say that if you think that you understand quantum physics it means that you have not undestood it at all, well this video helps you to understand what super position is, imagine that you have marbles that are being shoot trough a slit, all the marbles that fit that slit will draw a pattern, now instead of marbles we have waves, all the waves that fit the free slots will create a different pattern than marbles do, we have a rough patter for physical things like marbles and a interfered pattern for matter things like waves, well some physcis done this experiment but with photons (physical stuff), and they discover that this photons create a patter like waves instead like marbles, then they tried to undestand why this happend and they put an observer to see what slit were used and when the photons were observed the patter changes to rough patter like marbles, and this behaviour of having different patterns but you choose one of them when you are being observed is named super position.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0s6ZLkV-U0&ab_channel=EnricLlad%C3%B3" class="inside-links" target="_blank">La mejor presentación de tu vida:</a></strong><br>La mejor presentación de tu vida no es la que estás haciendo hoy, si no la siguiente que vas a hacer porque aprenderás de tus errores y podrás hacer una mejor o mejor dicho la mejor presentación hasta ese momento en tu vida, para poder mejorar aquí hay unos consejos</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Explica por qué es importante lo que vas a exponer</li>
		<li>No te proecupes en lo que estás haciendo si no en lo que quieres transmitir</li>
		<li>Hacer que la gente piense cosas</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Punto de flujo, pensar constantemente con el minimo esfuerzo</li>
			<li>Meterle una chispa (algo útil ya sea el concepto o la forma en la que lo presentas)</li>
			<li>Simplifica tu información para que sean fácil de entender</li>
			<li>Dale forma a tu información, dale un orden a las cosas</li>
			<li>Orden deductivo - De lo general a lo particular</li>
			<li>Orden inductivi - De lo particular a lo general</li>
			<li>Ordena por bloques</li>
			<li>Usa estrucuturas (vaso de agua)</li>
			<li>Que la estructura siempre esté presente</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hacer que la gente sienta cosas</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Haz que participen (preguntas)</li>
			<li>Haz preguntas que hagan sentir bien a la audiencia</li>
			<li>no digas "sí pero" mejor dí "Sí y ademas"</li>
			<li>Felicita la particiáción</li>
			<li>Usa imagenes cuando se pueda en vez de palabras</li>
			<li>Emplea objetos de la vida real</li>
			<li>Gestiona el ritmo con los tonos de voz</li>
			<li>no llenes de texto y si lo haces, cada click es una palabra</li>
			<li>Emite tus propias emociones, si no lo sientes, no lo transmites</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA_8IO3vbFs&ab_channel=GoogleWorkspace" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Moonshot Thinking from Astro Teller:</a></strong><br>All the companies say "Fail fast" but they do not undertands what this means, also companies say "get a moonshot thinking" but the do not understand what this means either, failing fast and having a moonshot thinking means that you will fail 90% of the time or 9/10 projects will fail, so is super important learn how to fail fast and when is time to stop projects or to try new stuff, this philosophy is about beaing brave and beaing creative, you need money and is important but is not all that matters, so fail fast and be brave</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdqC2bVLesQ&ab_channel=WorldScienceFestival" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Measure for Measure - Quantum Physics and Reality:</a></strong><br>Every one talks about quantum mechanics, but nobody know waht quantum means and that why all the brands try tu use quantum in their products because nobody knows what it is but averone knows that it is good beacuse si complex and is the key for our future, well basically all that we undesrstan as Quantum is based in the double slit experiment (check that explanation) and basically it says that on very small scales electrons do not behave as they sopouse to behave, instead they start to do some crazy stuf like behaving as waves, well this have a lot of mathemical background but in conclusion if you know what is the actual input of something you can calculate the future and this statement is radical because we start to see around us with other eyes and is unlikey that exists another unirverses but this probabilty is not 0</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc&ab_channel=GoogleTechTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don't Want You to Know</a></strong><br>This video is click bait but the speaker is honest and do this clarification at the begginig, but is no click bait at all because he is traying to show us a different way of understanding the quantum mechanics maths but instead of the calssical view, he uses the information theory to give it a side view, but to be honest I have not understand at all what is the main point but one thiks is more clear for me, maybe the multiverse does not exist and neither the instan commmunication but like Albert Einstein said "The most incomprehensible thing abut the universe is that is comprehensible" and maybe that is the main point about this talk</p>

	<h2>Readings</h2>
	<p><strong><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a></strong><br>Test Driven Development or TDD is a idealy workflow when you have to make tests between each stage of you lifecycle development, there are 5 stages and this worflow or loop for developing looks like this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Code</li>
		<ul><li>Test</li></ul>
		<li>Integrate</li>
		<ul><li>Test</li></ul>
		<li>Deploy</li>
		<ul><li>Test</li></ul>
		<li>Release</li>
		<ul><li>Test</li></ul>
		<li>Steer</li>
		<ul><li>Test</li></ul>
		<li>Repeat</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some recomendations for doing this tests or better code are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself)</li>
		<li>Make modular (every module only does one thing)</li>
		<li>Unit Testing</li>
		<li>Refactor</li>
		<li>When coding think about what you want to do</li>
		<li>When coding think about how to test your code</li>
		<li>Run test and then fix if there were errors or bugs</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html" class="inside-links" target="_blank">UnitTest</a></strong><br>Unit tsting is a good practice for doing maintainable code, this practice was introduced when Extreme Programming was popular, and this practice has a lot of variations but there is one idea in common "Units (The small  block of code for testing)"</p>
	<p>Exist two basic method for doing Unit Testing: Solitary or Sociable, the difference between them is if you choose a unique block that dos not have interaction or dependency with other blocks or choosing various block that interact between them, this is a variant of the definition of Unit but depends of the programmer and her/his team what they define as a Unit</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Xunit.html" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Xunit</a></strong><br>Xunit is a fancy word to referer a familly of bunch of frameworks for testing and thats all, exist differents imlementations depending the programming language that you are using, for example: the firts implementation was for SmallTalk, then was implemented a version for C++ named CppUnit and even there is an implementation for Java named isVAforJava</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-build-tools-for-dependency-management" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Java Build Tools for Dependency Management:</a></strong><br>I learned about differents tools for managing dependencies in Java, but Maven was the most remarkable; <a href="https://www.jrebel.com/blog/getting-started-with-java-build-tools#set-up">Here</a> there is a guide for Maven and Gradel installation, these are the basic commands:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>mvn compile</li>
		<li>mvn test</li>
		<li>mvn package</li>
		<li>mvn help:describe -Dplugin=org.apache.tomcat.maven:tomcat7-maven-plugin</li>
		<li>mvn deploy</li>
		<li>mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is the build cycle of maven</p>
	<ul>
		<li>validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available</li>
		<li>compile - compile the source code of the project</li>
		<li>test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code packaged or deployed</li>
		<li>package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.</li>
		<li>verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met</li>
		<li>install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally</li>
		<li>deploy- done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Extra</p>
	<ul>
		<li>mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false</li>
		<li>mvn package</li>
		<li>java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App</li>
	</ul>
