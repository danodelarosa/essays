	<h2>Videos</h2>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CKW4A6jnJA&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">TEDxCaltech - Danny Hillis - Reminiscing about Richard Feynman</a></strong><br>This is not a techical video, this is about remeber a good old friend and the speaker does not say what is the porpouse of his talk, but I guess is about how to face problems, you always should face them with a smile and funny atitude, I would like to be more like Richard Feynman</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miKIWIYi4w&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">TEDxCaltech - Tony Hey - Feynman and Computation</a></strong><br>Who was Feynman? Richard Feynman was a physicist and an awesome leader (IMB at Los Alamos), also he was an hard worker, he helped to re calculate "Friend's Work", Feynman also realize the idea of quantum computer not as a Turing machine, finally we can say feynman not was just a funny guy he thought diffent to others.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw&ab_channel=seabala" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Feynman on Scientific Method.</a></strong><br>The scientific metod is not about smart people or cool guys, is about facts, if you have a Guess about somthing, you need to describe the consecuences and all about you are guessing and then make an experiment, if your idea does not match with the result of the experiment, the asnwer is your idea or guess is wrong, there is no more and that is science, is about proving guesses.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AqxNekecY&ab_channel=Pretotyping" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The Pretotyping Manifesto - Stanford Graduate School of Business</a></strong><br>Pretotyping is different from Prototyping, Usually people wants to create a new company but if you do not know what the final user wants or needs your company or product will fail and it is normal, 95% of innovative ideas will fail, but if you want to reduce that percentage you should "Fake it before make it" (Pretoryping before prototyping) because any entrepeneur fall in the ilusion of doing all perfect, and instead of having real data that supports the product, they have an ideal opinion of what they think the user will do with their product, so if you want to create a innovation, start with a pretotyping and start with pre instead pro bacause you can have a Innovator nightmares, this means investing millions (time and mony) in the perfect prodcut that nobody wants or needs so Instead of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vision have a reality</li>
		<li>Ideas have a prototype (or pretotyping)</li>
		<li>Opinions have data</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Test per Types
			<ul>
				<li>Functions</li>
				<li>Statement</li>
				<li>Branch</li>
				<li>Others</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Test per Project</li>
		<li>Test per Commit</li>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ&list=PLm4zG1ucbXnXTGfqr-JaIoYpq502spti4&index=4&ab_channel=TED" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Stephen Wolfram: Computando hacia una teoría de todo</a></strong><br>Programming and computers are just tools for getting answers for realy complex problems that we could never imagine thanks to its complex nature, I do not know if Stephen Wolfram is saying if the whole universe is just a computer, an algorithm or a "simulation" but we have in our hands a powerfull key for answer questions and que should use it wisely</p>

But When I Do, I Test in Production</a></strong><br>Netflix at least in 2014 had a philosophy of not just doing the basic tests (unit, integration and stress), they had in mind that the real problems occurs in production, and this was learned by the bad way, so they created or implemented new ways for testing and not hust because they can, they had to do this because Netflix is so complex and distributed that is difficult make stable and bullet proof versions or simply there are outside factors that netflix can not handle and for trying to create better software and a more stable Natflix they implement 3 different and extra tests in their production version</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simian Army (simulated growing distruction)</li>
		<li>Production code coverage and analysis (find the real user's path ways)</li>
		<li>Canary Deployments (Push small number of instances)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>*TIP* make tests for checking if other of your services is slow down or could be broken by the shutdown of another</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/kolton-andrus-on-breaking-things-at-netflix/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Kolton Andrus on Breaking Things at Netflix</a></strong><br>Did you know that exists a work where you brake things just for see what happens? well in neftlix exists a whole team that understands this "mistakes and broken systems always will happen, but how to face, fix and handle them is what defines you" is similar to vaccines, is not about only using face masks (tests before deployment) is about giving you a reduced version of a virus (braking things in production but in a safe or controled space) to see how you body will react to this problem (solve this simulated problems for future disasters) so thanks to this thinking Kotlon Andrus create FIT (Failure Injection Testing) an autoserved framework for helping to make resilient systems.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7c0Bw840X8&ab_channel=GoogleTechTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">GTAC 2014: The Testing User Experience</a></strong><br>Testing is like being healthy, everyone knows that eating vegatables and excercising is the best thing for your life, but nobody does it, so why engineers thinks testing is a waste of time if is healthy for code? because they think that you need to test every single function and that yes is a waste of time, so instead of seeing testing like a finder bugs only think it like a time saver, if you do testing properly it will save you from writing boring stuff about a mistake, error or bug, instead you can code more things, another tip is try to first fix what the user needs or sees and what breaks the system.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I47TcQmYyo4&ab_channel=TVODocs" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Seth Lloyd on Programming the Universe</a></strong><br>Every systema that can hold at least 2 different states can store information like a computer, we usually think in computers like the more awesome syste, for processing iformation, but exist another awesome sytems like the languages, printed word or spoken word, these depends the region for being used, but computer are a Universal language like maths, but a more awesome system is the human and the sexual revolution, an asexual system depends of a mutation for creating something new, but two humans can create a super system from different information sources, and following this thought, The univers by it self and the big bang is the first system that was processing iformation all this thanks to quantum physics, quantum computers scares because with this technology we can break codes but more than that, we can replicate th "Theory of algoritmic iformation" or "The typing monkeys" and thnaks to that understand or see the universe as a big computer wher god play dices.</p>
