	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CKW4A6jnJA&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">TEDxCaltech - Danny Hillis - Reminiscing about Richard Feynman</a></strong><br>This is not a techical video, this is about remeber a good old friend and the speaker does not say what is the porpouse of his talk, but I guess is about how to face problems, you always should face them with a smile and funny atitude, I would like to be more like Richard Feynman</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miKIWIYi4w&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">TEDxCaltech - Tony Hey - Feynman and Computation</a></strong><br>Who was Feynman? Richard Feynman was a physicist and an awesome leader (IMB at Los Alamos), also he was an hard worker, he helped to re calculate "Friend's Work", Feynman also realize the idea of quantum computer not as a Turing machine, finally we can say feynman not was just a funny guy he thought diffent to others.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw&ab_channel=seabala" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Feynman on Scientific Method.</a></strong><br>The scientific metod is not about smart people or cool guys, is about facts, if you have a Guess about somthing, you need to describe the consecuences and all about you are guessing and then make an experiment, if your idea does not match with the result of the experiment, the asnwer is your idea or guess is wrong, there is no more and that is science, is about proving guesses.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AqxNekecY&ab_channel=Pretotyping" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The Pretotyping Manifesto - Stanford Graduate School of Business</a></strong><br>Pretotyping is different from Prototyping, Usually people wants to create a new company but if you do not know what the final user wants or needs your company or product will fail and it is normal, 95% of innovative ideas will fail, but if you want to reduce that percentage you should "Fake it before make it" (Pretoryping before prototyping) because any entrepeneur fall in the ilusion of doing all perfect, and instead of having real data that supports the product, they have an ideal opinion of what they think the user will do with their product, so if you want to create a innovation, start with a pretotyping and start with pre instead pro bacause you can have a Innovator nightmares, this means investing millions (time and mony) in the perfect prodcut that nobody wants or needs so Instead of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vision have a reality</li>
		<li>Ideas have a prototype (or pretotyping)</li>
		<li>Opinions have data</li>
	</ul>
