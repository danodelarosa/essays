	<h2>Pretotypes</h2>
	<h3>Pretotype 1 - Super Market List</h3>
	<p>Description: This idea is about create a supermarket list App to carry out the total money of your products along with functionality to compare prices between products and thus choose the best option</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hypothesis: This application will help the user to manage his supermarket list by knowing at all times the total amount of money of his shopping cart and by comparing prices of different products the user could obtain the best option to add.</li>
		<li>Experiment description: I will simulate the app with my calculator and a notepad; I will accompany a person who will buy his supermarket list, then I will save all the products and their prices, then when the user needs a comparison, I will do this function to give him the lowest price or when the user needs the total amount carried I will be able to give it to him instantaneously.</li>
		<li>Validation:</li>
		<p>In this picture we can see a supermarket list, this is the user's list with his products and their prices</p>
		<img src="images/pretotype1_1.jpg" width="270" height="540">
		<p>Here we can see the sum in real-time, at this moment the user can check if he is overpassing the budget</p>
		<img src="images/pretotype1_3.jpg" width="270" height="480">
		<p>Here we have an example of comparison</p>
		<p>In this calculator we have a product with a price of $47.5 with 300 grams</p>
		<img src="images/pretotype1_2.jpg" width="270" height="540">
		<p>In this another calculator we have the same product but with different presentation, it costs $80 but has 525 grams</p>
		<img src="images/pretotype1_4.jpg" width="270" height="480">
		<p>So the cheapest option is the second product</p>
		<li>Results:<br>The user found useful both options (continous total amount and products comparison) also said "I can not wait for use it"<br>This result is what I expected, I would like to implement a first versión or a demo because this App could help me to do my supermarket list.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Pretotype 2 - Marketplace</h3>
	<p>Description: This idea is about creating an APP for local shops or businesses using P2P architecture, where the business user can download the app on his smartphone and serve his products since his device without a host and the consumer user can download the app for searching: local business, products and prices; then by getting a service or product the user can validate the authenticity of that business and reputation</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hypothesis: This application will help all small businesses to have an Internet presence at no cost using their smartphones and consumer users will be able to search all available local businesses with their products and prices and all those in an easy way.</li>
		<li>Experiment description: I will simulate the app by asking 3 near businesses if they have an Internet presence, if they are interested in a free app to download and store/upload their names, location, contact, products and prices then I will ask them for their 3 best-selling products and prices, then I will write all that data in sheets (one sheet per business) to simulate the APP, then I will ask to 3 different consumer users if they are interested in an app for searching local businesses and products, if they know about their local business and finally I will simulate a searching scenario with one product and the sheets.</li>
		<li>Validation: Here we have the 3 sheets previously mentioned
			<br>Business 1<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_1.png" width="254" height="139">
			<br>Business 2<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_2.png" width="298" height="130">
			<br>Business 3<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_3.png" width="259" height="142">
			<br>Then we ask to 3 different consumers<br>
			<br>Consumer 1: She bought Doritos in miscelanea luna because was nearby to her house<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_4.png" width="228" height="52">
			<br>Consumer 2: She bough Cheetos in Supercito because were cheaper than in miscelanea luna<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_5.png" width="214" height="52">
			<br>Consumer 3: She bought Pastor and she did not know that carnicería Nancy had Pastor ready to cook<br>
			<img src="images/pretotype2_6.png" width="311" height="52">
		</li>
		<li>Results:<br>Both Corner Stores (Miscelanea Luna and Supercito) said that the idea is great but should be super hard trying to implement or use the app because they have a lot of products and will be so tedious try to add every product in their stores, also Carnicería nancy said that should be a great idea but if you could have an delivery service offered by the app<br>The consumers said that is an awesome idea and they can wait to download it, because this app could help them to know new local business and see if their local stores have what they want, the schedule, location and prices to compare which one is the best option or the cheapest, also they said that a delivery service should be great<br>I guess that the idea for consumer users is practical but for business user is not, maybe if we could link their inventory system with the app, the app should be more easy to use for the business user, but thanks for the differences between inventory systems this could be so hard to implement, obviously the delivery service is out of our hands but could be a good new moonshot idea</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Pretotype 3: Debts and debtors</h3>
	<p>Description: This idea is about creating an App for managing to whom you debt and who debts to you, this idea is oriented for small businesses who have various daily transactions and debts, for example a corner, butcher or poultry store, the main ideas is creating a list where the user can add a new name, a tag and a color (for debt or debtor) and an amount of money, if someone paid a bit of his doubt, you can reduce the amount and when the debt is paid you can delete that name, something similiar would happen with your debts, if you have a debt with someone you can add his name and when you pay a bit of your doubt you could reduce the amount or when you pay off your debt, you can delete the name.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hypothesis: This app will help to small business to having a better control over their debts and debtors, giving to them an easy way to handle all that data in one same place and avoiding trying to remeber who gives you money and when, instead the user could have a log in their smartphone to query every time that this could be needed</li>
		<li>Experiment description:I will simulate the app with my notepad and a calculatore, I will acompany a chiken seller in one day pf job and when he need to add a debt or a debtor I will write in my notepad and with my calculator I will sum or subtract the required amount, at the end of the day I will give to the User a log with all the operations</li>
		<li>Validation: Disclaimer "for privacy I will not show the real list, instead I will show a short and simulated list"
			<img src="images/pretotype3_1.png" width="405" height="205"></li>
		<li>Results: The user said that is super functional the idea but is impractical, having me at his side was helpful, because he only was saying what we wants and then I write it in my notepad but in a real-life escenario he should uses his smartphone and that means wash his hands every time to add a new name int that way avoid touching dirty objects and then manipulate the raw chiken, he said that maybe with a virtual asissten with voice this could help him to do this task<br>I guess that the user had reason but with his job, maybe other user could use it, but at least with this validation the idea fails in execution, maybe adding that voice assistant anyone could use it</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miKIWIYi4w&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">TEDxCaltech - Tony Hey - Feynman and Computation</a></strong><br>Who was Feynman? Richard Feynman was a physicist and an awesome leader (IMB at Los Alamos), also he was an hard worker, he helped to re calculate "Friend's Work", Feynman also realize the idea of quantum computer not as a Turing machine, finally we can say feynman not was just a funny guy he thought diffent to others.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw&ab_channel=seabala" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Feynman on Scientific Method.</a></strong><br>The scientific metod is not about smart people or cool guys, is about facts, if you have a Guess about somthing, you need to describe the consecuences and all about you are guessing and then make an experiment, if your idea does not match with the result of the experiment, the asnwer is your idea or guess is wrong, there is no more and that is science, is about proving guesses.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AqxNekecY&ab_channel=Pretotyping" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The Pretotyping Manifesto - Stanford Graduate School of Business</a></strong><br>Pretotyping is different from Prototyping, Usually people wants to create a new company but if you do not know what the final user wants or needs your company or product will fail and it is normal, 95% of innovative ideas will fail, but if you want to reduce that percentage you should "Fake it before make it" (Pretoryping before prototyping) because any entrepeneur fall in the ilusion of doing all perfect, and instead of having real data that supports the product, they have an ideal opinion of what they think the user will do with their product, so if you want to create a innovation, start with a pretotyping and start with pre instead pro bacause you can have a Innovator nightmares, this means investing millions (time and mony) in the perfect prodcut that nobody wants or needs so Instead of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vision have a reality</li>
		<li>Ideas have a prototype (or pretotyping)</li>
		<li>Opinions have data</li>

But When I Do, I Test in Production</a></strong><br>Netflix at least in 2014 had a philosophy of not just doing the basic tests (unit, integration and stress), they had in mind that the real problems occurs in production, and this was learned by the bad way, so they created or implemented new ways for testing and not hust because they can, they had to do this because Netflix is so complex and distributed that is difficult make stable and bullet proof versions or simply there are outside factors that netflix can not handle and for trying to create better software and a more stable Natflix they implement 3 different and extra tests in their production version</p>

	<p>*TIP* make tests for checking if other of your services is slow down or could be broken by the shutdown of another</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/kolton-andrus-on-breaking-things-at-netflix/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Kolton Andrus on Breaking Things at Netflix</a></strong><br>Did you know that exists a work where you brake things just for see what happens? well in neftlix exists a whole team that understands this "mistakes and broken systems always will happen, but how to face, fix and handle them is what defines you" is similar to vaccines, is not about only using face masks (tests before deployment) is about giving you a reduced version of a virus (braking things in production but in a safe or controled space) to see how you body will react to this problem (solve this simulated problems for future disasters) so thanks to this thinking Kotlon Andrus create FIT (Failure Injection Testing) an autoserved framework for helping to make resilient systems.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7c0Bw840X8&ab_channel=GoogleTechTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">GTAC 2014: The Testing User Experience</a></strong><br>Testing is like being healthy, everyone knows that eating vegatables and excercising is the best thing for your life, but nobody does it, so why engineers thinks testing is a waste of time if is healthy for code? because they think that you need to test every single function and that yes is a waste of time, so instead of seeing testing like a finder bugs only think it like a time saver, if you do testing properly it will save you from writing boring stuff about a mistake, error or bug, instead you can code more things, another tip is try to first fix what the user needs or sees and what breaks the system.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I47TcQmYyo4&ab_channel=TVODocs" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Seth Lloyd on Programming the Universe</a></strong><br>Every systema that can hold at least 2 different states can store information like a computer, we usually think in computers like the more awesome syste, for processing iformation, but exist another awesome sytems like the languages, printed word or spoken word, these depends the region for being used, but computer are a Universal language like maths, but a more awesome system is the human and the sexual revolution, an asexual system depends of a mutation for creating something new, but two humans can create a super system from different information sources, and following this thought, The univers by it self and the big bang is the first system that was processing iformation all this thanks to quantum physics, quantum computers scares because with this technology we can break codes but more than that, we can replicate th "Theory of algoritmic iformation" or "The typing monkeys" and thnaks to that understand or see the universe as a big computer wher god play dices.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkBPp9UovVU&ab_channel=GoogleTechTalks" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Seth Lloyd: Quantum Machine Learning</a></strong><br>Linear algebra is important because we can see machine learning as vectors, same with quantum mechanics or quantum computing, if you can create a quantum-ram you can create a quantum-search<br>Quantum algorithms are faster than classical implementations (at least the based in linear algebra)<br>This is about taken taken advantage of the mathematical form of quantum mechanics to convert classical implementations into a quantum ram to create quantum optimizations or at least do quantum machine learning (like Seth says: "if you have quantum in your titles or big data, your project will win more founds" hahaha) and all these can be made thanks to linear algebra.</p>
