	<h2>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware & Software - Charles Petzold</h2>
	<p>Computers are complex tools and the way they work seem magic, but before computers the problem of computing masive data were done with a a bunch of mathematicians doing repetitive calculus and for communicating long distances, people sent messages riding horses, then the telegraph was invented and sending dot and dashes, communication was made faster, thanks to this invention the first logic gates were implemented (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR) and any computer is basically made by connecting various logic gates between them (bit adders, flip-flops, memory, etc) and remember, all this was made thanks to dot and dashes, the information that pass trough logic gates is nothing else than bits (ones and zeros or 5 and 0 volts), but before our binary communication system, dot and dashes represented letters, the less amount of dots were the most used letters like E, I, or S, and the less used letters like Q, J or Z have the most amount of dots, this method of coding messages is more or less efficient but exist another coding method like binary, that represents information with the same amount of packets of bits (for example 8 bit is 1 packet or 1 byte), this is more data per letter, but is more practical of remember and basically the number of things that can be represent using this system is infity, instead of using long amount of bytes all the time, the hexadecimal system was implemented because is more human readable (but at the end hexadecimal is translated to binary), instead of using 8 bits, now we use 2 digits that goes from 0 to F (16 different values) this together shortcuts for doing certain task like add, substract, store and load, was the first programming language named "Assembly" that helps to humans write precise instructions for using a computer without writing direct binary language (machine code), but this task of reading the input of a human, writing this shortcuts or commands, loading, storing and printing messages on screen is very difficult, so the firs operating system was created with the goal of handling all this complex stuff, then the programmer realized the you can translate a more human readeable language to assembly, maybe this will cost more computing time but will accelerate and simplify writing new programms, all this was an commercial war between companies of technologie, like motorola, Intel, IBM but all this avances made way for all the amazing technology of now days, like complex 3D graphics, banking systems, video games, smartphones and quantum computers, and all thanks to sending or not a bit of electricity.</p>

	<h2>Learning How to Learn</h2>
	<p>Barbara Ockley says that we have 2 different modes for using our brain:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Focused mode (a small board where everything is erase easily but where we can do fast things and can have full attention)</li>
		<li>Defused mode (a big storage where we can storage for long term and wher we store our thought patterns)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We learn using these modes in intercalated form; by repeating a task in focused mode we can move the  task to the long term memory, where we can use our defused mode to create new neuronal connections and new knowledge or for being creative</p>

	<p>To help this process of changing between modes, we should sleep enough and doing excersice, because defused mode is activated when we do not concentrate in the specific task, for exmaple while sleeping, doing excercise or even doing other tasks, sleep is recommended because you clean all the toxines in your brain, and excersice because it gives you serotonine, dopamine and other substances that are prove that are needen for the learning process</p>

	<p>We learn by repeating small tasks, not just reading all the book or our note one night before an exam, so to create a better technique for learning you should create chunks of information, for example</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Recall after reading or watching a video</li>

		<li>Minimize highlighting and instead try to remember the main topics</li>
		<li>Divide a topic in subtopic and learn a bit every day (perserverance is the key)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Another techniques for a better learning are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Learn different disciplines (patterns or approaches in one area can be transfered to another areas for undestanding and learning)</li>
		<li>Interleave betwwen easy and hard problems (if you only do simple problems, you will fall in the illusion of mastering something)</li>
		<li>Test yourself (1 hour of testing is much better than 1 hour of simple learning or repetition)</li>
		<li>Create cards with images that or notes, for practicing</li>
		<li>Memory palace</li>
		<li>Use Mnomics, analogies and metaphors</li>
		<li>Try to use mental images, sounds or feelings to match new chunks of memory like a date of a parent to remeber a number</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you are lazy or a procrastinator, try pomodoro, work focused for 30 minutes and finishing take a break of 5 minutes, do this 4 times and for your 4th break, take a long break of 30 minutes, at the end of a short or long break, reward yourself in this way you can create a new habbit and with practice you can measure how many pomodoros you need for a specific task</p>

	<p>A new habbit is created with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cue</li>
		<li>Reaction</li>
		<li>Routine</li>
		<li>Reward</li>
		<li>Belief or mind-set</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you have problems with organization:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a to-do list for your month and your day-to-day</li>
		<li>Plan your quitting time</li>
		<li>Create a space dedicated just for doing funny stuff</li>
		<li>Do the most important disgusting and boring stuff first (if you have a few things to do)</li>
		<li>Do the shorter tasks firts to reduce your list (if you have a lot of things to do)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If your get stuck in one hard problem, activate your defuse mode by jumping to an easy problem, when you finished or realiz the answer, comeback to the hard priblmes</p>

	<p>Avoid stress yourself because cortisol (getted by stress) is going to brake, so try to change your mindset from panic or fear to this challenge is going to helps me to improve my skills and if you are stuck in panic try the "Controlled and deep breathing"</p>

	<p>Remember, the most important is sleep enough and doing excercise</p>

	<h2>Passionate Programmer â€“ Chad Flower </h2>
	<p>This book has title very self explanatory, this is a guide with tons of practical tips to become or at least look or work like a passionate programmer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Love it or leave it<br>To be a passionate programmer you need to love what you do, that is the difference between being a simpler programmer or an excellent one, another reason for loving what you do is because you will have good and bad days, but at least if you love coding there will be less worst days</li>
		<li>Be the worst<br>You should try to be the worst teammate in your team, not for doing less or mediocre task, instead learn from others, if you are the worst dude you can learn froom anyone and by this way you could improve yourself faster</li>
		<li>Get a mentor and be a mentor<br>When you start to learn a new skill, find someone than can help you to solve your dubts and if you want to master something try to tech what have you learned</li>
		<li>Study things that were done yet to learn how it was done</li>
		<li>Be a generalist and a specialist<br>Learn a bit of everthing but have a subject where you have deeper domain and knowledge </li>
		<li>Automate your workflow</li>
		<li>Invest in your product<br>Treat your career as a product
			<ul>
				<li>Get a good product (Choose technologies on demand)</li>
				<li>Add value (Gain experience)</li>
				<li>Execute (Use your new skill)</li>
				<li>Marketing (Sell your expertice with this technologie)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Learn to fail</li>
		<li>Acomplish your goals, deadlines ans promises</li>
		<li>Learn to communicate (send feedback, report what you were doing)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Being a passionate programmer means having a remarkable career in IT or you can think that you will have a remarkable career if your are passionate with your work, I guess this is aplicable in any other field, if you do your best every day, trying to improve yourself and love what you do, is the key for succes, because you will invest everything and all the rewards will come more easily but this will happens only if you can create a well defined plan for acomplish your goals</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>I have learned this month that you need to learn about or take adavntage from your mistakes, you need to learn from someone that knows more than you, if you want to learn deeper you should teach or share your knowledge and is foundamental being nice with everyone and if your want to achieve your goals you need pattience, having a plan and work everyday</p>
