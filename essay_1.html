	<h1>Essay 1</h1>	
	<p><strong>Lightning talk</strong>: for this first assigment I had to prepare a meeting to give a 15 minutes presentation of a topic related to technology, I am a pythonist so I choose to give a intro to python 3 for non python programmers (I named this presetation "python 34"), in this assigment I learned that I do not have to put myself under preshure for free, if you are having troobles or blockers, put yourself under stress do not help, so take it easy and I got this tip from my mentors who were also apprentices, so they gave me the most first and valuable advice for my entire software engineer career</p>
	<p>Also in this assigment I learned a lot about string formatting and old way fashion methods, I read some topics on functional programming and finally somthing clicked in my head that I understood how map and filter functions work</p>

	<h2>Readings</h2>
	<p><strong><a href="https://sive.rs/book/HowToTalkToAnyone" class="inside-links">How to talk to anyone:</a></strong> in this reading I learned different tips of how to talk with different persons and try to give a good impresion even there were tips for handling bad situation.
	Here there are some examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant<br>Technique (The Big-Baby Pivot): "I think you are very, very special." </li>

	<p>Sometimes we assume a lot of things by intuition but we need to use our intuition to ask questions, not to answer them </p>
	<p>And finally I learned about scar tissues, a relationship ends not by only one big and complex problem, usually a broken relationship is a snow ball of litthe issues, so when you notice that something is not going well, do something to fix it</p>
