	<h1>Essay 1</h1>	
	<p><strong>Lightning talk</strong>: for this first assigment I had to prepare a meeting to give a 15 minutes presentation of a topic related to technology, I am a pythonist so I choose to give a intro to python 3 for non python programmers (I named this presetation "python 34"), in this assigment I learned that I do not have to put myself under preshure for free, if you are having troobles or blockers, put yourself under stress do not help, so take it easy and I got this tip from my mentors who were also apprentices, so they gave me the most first and valuable advice for my entire software engineer career</p>
	<p>Also in this assigment I learned a lot about string formatting and old way fashion methods, I read some topics on functional programming and finally somthing clicked in my head that I understood how map and filter functions work</p>
