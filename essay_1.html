	<h1>Essay 1 ( Oct 5 - Oct 11 )</h1>	
	<p><strong>Lightning talk:</strong><br>For this first assigment I had to prepare a meeting to give a 15 minutes presentation of a topic related to technology, I am a pythonist so I choose to give a intro to python 3 for non python programmers (I named this presetation "python 34"), in this assigment I learned that I do not have to put myself under preshure for free, if you are having troobles or blockers, put yourself under stress do not help, so take it easy and I got this tip from my mentors who were also apprentices, so they gave me the most first and valuable advice for my entire software engineer career</p>
	<p>Also in this assigment I learned a lot about string formatting and old way fashion methods, I read some topics on functional programming and finally somthing clicked in my head that I understood how map and filter functions work</p>

	<h2>Readings</h2>
	<p><strong><a href="https://sive.rs/book/HowToTalkToAnyone" class="inside-links" target="_blank">How to talk to anyone:</a></strong><br> In this reading I learned different tips of how to talk with different persons and try to give a good impresion, even there were tips for handling bad situation.
	Here there are some examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant<br>Technique (The Big-Baby Pivot): "I think you are very, very special." </li>
		<br>
		<li>How to Introduce People Like the Host(ess) with the Most(est)<br>Technique (Never the Naked Introduction): Mention their hobby or even talent when introduce them</li>
		<br>
		<li>How to Never Need to Wonder, “What Do I Say Next?”<br>Technique (Parroting): repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-profound-life-lessons-from-Stanford-Professor-John-Ousterhout?share=1" class="inside-links" target="_blank">What are the most profound life lessons from Stanford Professor John Ousterhout?:</a></strong><br>With this reading I undesrtood is better having a finished and functionally project than an unfinished but optimized project, also I learned "is easier to change existing software than to build new software"</p>
	<p>Sometimes we assume a lot of things by intuition but we need to use our intuition to ask questions, not to answer them </p>
	<p>And finally I learned about scar tissues, a relationship ends not by only one big and complex problem, usually a broken relationship is a snow ball of little issues, so when you notice that something is not going well, do something to fix it</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://sive.rs/multiply" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Ideas are just a multiplier of execution:</a></strong><br>In this reading I reallyze how important is no just having a good idea, is more about how to implement it, the reading gives a table where says that not all is about ideas but you should be carefull with the bad ideas because a bad idea is going to arruine even the most brilliant execution</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Missing semester - The linux shell:</a></strong><br>Here my learning was more technical, I feel very confident with my knowledge about Linux, but as I have learned: You should always wear a white belt, so I was open for learning and discover something new .e.g.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>date -> Mon Oct 11 18:18:20 CDT 2021</li>
		<li>is which not wich (it gives the path of any app)</li>
		<li>use scape character to do inline spaces -> echo Hello\ world == echo "Hello world"</li>
		<li>ctrl + l == clear</li>
		<li>cat < file.txt > copy.txt (it prints and create a copy file)</li>
		<li>grep --ignore-case "some text" == grep -i "some text"</li>
		<li>The # in a scripting file means runs as root</li>
		<li>Executing something inline as root -> echo 1060 | sudo tee brightness </li>
		<li>Scripting for zhs -> "#!/bin/zsh"</li>
		<li>Scripting for python in venv -> "#!/usr/bin/env python3"</li>
		<li>Open files with open or Xdg-open</li>

	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/documents/reports-results-and-publications/autopilot-britain-whitepaper.pdf" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Autopilot Britain:</a></strong><br>We usually live our lifes in an automatic mode and is not bad at all because we take huge different decisitions in our day-to-day and we need to do tasks without over-thinking but what happend with all that small decisition that models our future I mean our habbits, bad habbits give us the worst version of ourselfs, so wee could take care about those decisitions that we can change to improve our skills and future e.g.</p>

	<h2>Videos</h2>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MYsx6WArKY&ab_channel=TED" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Jonathan Haidt - Religión, evolución y el éxtasis de la autotrascendencia:</a></strong><br>There is a theory that says "humans are religious by nature" this is not trying to say that we belive on gods, it means that the nature of the human is beign transcendent helping others, having an common goal as group, not being selfish, and this theory explains that this is a evolutionary bias, we form groups because we have more survival probability if we stay grouped, but that was in the past when we could not haunt a big animal for feed us, but now that our needs had being covered, what happend? is necesary being part of a gruop?, maslow say that our goal as human is to scale a pyramid, since the bottom, covering our physiological needs unitl the top where que can get the self actualization, but this means beign more selfish because we focus our energy improving ourself, it means a lot of effort but if you rise the top you could be part of the everything like in a religion, is that curious and para doxical right? So I learned that to be a good partner, a good son, a good friend, a good boyfriend or girlfriend and even a good coworker you need to be ok first and then you can colaborate and being part of a group</p>
