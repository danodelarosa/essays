	<ul>
		<li>Firts things first "you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else" this means "you have to be a nice person with social skills"</li>
		
		<li> Do not be afriad of making mistakes, mistakes guide you to an oportunity for improving yourself, so go ahead and fail</li>
		
		<li>Do not be Territorial, touch others code and let them touch your code and in this same way lose your ego, ego contribute nothing but it makes the team work harder, so lose your ego</li>
		
		<li>Critics are good, be open to reviews, is the same like failing but with experimented comments and talking about experience</li>
		
		<li>Be the little fish, this means "you shuld be open to learn from everyone" if your are a little fish is more easy to grow up</li>
		
		<li>Encourage the people to do good things</li>
		
		<li>Document your failures</li>
		
		<li>Pay attention to your tools and your timing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you do all these things, people will think you are a genius</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Network / Load Time / Critial Path</li>
		<li>Render / Images / Videos / DOM</li>
		<li>Compute / JS code</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqc418tQDkg&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The LZ77 Compression Family (Ep 2, Compressor Head):</a></strong><br>The Familly LZ77 and LZ78 is the actual lineage for compression algorithms, all this fammilly has some in common and it is tokenizer values that already exist in the stream for reducing the amount of click/bits that are needed for a less entrophy, this fammily has give us algorithms like 7ZIP, WINRAR, GZIP and others.</p>
	<p>Talks safe: spaces, agile, </p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05RFEGWNxts&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Markov Chain Compression (Ep 3, Compressor Head):</a></strong><br>There is another super hero in the compression history and is the "Markov chain", this is a probabilistic algorithm that use Variable Lenght Codes but with particularity of the next item or event that accurs next depends only by state attained in the previous event</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTCuYzAw31Y&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google I/O 2012 - The Art of Organizational Manipulation:</a></strong><br>The title of this video is tricky, it is no about how to manipulate an organization, this video is about how to learn to work with people in corporations, in this video explain the difference between and ideal or perfect working environment and the real life situations and I got surprised beacuse Encora has all the characteristics for a perfect environment e.g.:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Servant Leadership</li>
		<li>Pursue Responsability</li>
		<li>Questions things</li>
		<li>Act like and Adult</li>
		<li>Take risks and Expand comfort zone</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-7l8cnpI4k&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google I/O 2011: Programming Well with Others - Social Skills for Geeks:</a></strong><br>Every developer wants to have the edgy technical knowledge but working in the software industry does not mean having only technical skills, think in your favorite open source project, this project was made only by one persone?, not right?, well working in the software industry means working with people so you need social skills or maybe something more siple like tips and in this video Brian and Ben explain that working with people is like working with a compiler, you do not write 10,000 lines of code and then is ready por production, you write some lines and then run the compiler and you get feedback to improve your software or add a new feature, so ask to your coworkers or teammates if you are doing somethinf good or not good, if you have a doubt of how to intreact with someone, ask him/her how to do it (run your social compiler), here ar another tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Perpetuate the respect: If you start working respectfully, it is going to be like this always, other wise if you start working angry or without respect, so you will continue working how!?</li>
		<li>Share your ideas: Communicate what you are doing and where you are going to, with your teamate because that way everyone will know if as Team you are working well or there is someone clueless</li>
		<li>If there is no manager, someone need to take the leadership</li>
		<li>Be responsible and comunicative</li>
		<li>Have the 3 keys of Knowledge industry:
			<ul>
				<li>Autonomy</li>
				<li>Mastery</li>
				<li>Purpose</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How to deal with a jerk?: Is valid to protect your culture but if you confront a toxic guy you will play his/her game, so the best options is not feeding with your energy that mosnter, instead just ignore and concentrate on doing your stuff</li>
		<li>Do no answer with violence to violence</li>
		<li>Is against the behavior not he person: There are such awesome developers that acts like a jerk, but this jerking atitude is a behavior, so try to "fight" against the actions or the behavior, not the person, instead of saying "your are a Jerk" is better say "your actions and your behavior only make others feel bad, stop treating us badly, you are here for doing software"</li>
		<li>You are here for doing software: This basically means do not be a jerk</li>
		<li>Recognize people when they are doing good thins</li>
		<li>Do no try to get credit for everything</li>
		<li>Build a reputation of trust: let people trust on you</li>
		<li>Learn to talk non techie</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Developing Expertise - Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep:</a></strong><br>This video starts with a powerful phrase "without excelent personnel, even good to excellent processes can only achieve marginal results", We have heard that theres is more to learn than just programming or technical skills, but in this video is about how to improve your hardskill with a softskill technique</p>
	<p>In our teams exist different types of persons but let's focus on two types, the wizards and the novices, wizards are mythological creatures that understand everything and fix everything, usually when you have a problem you ask crying to this dude how to fix it, and exist the novices, these are newbies and they need help and a detailed explanation for any task, the porpouse of this video is help to every developer in this journey of becoming from a novice into an expert wizard</p>

	<p>This journey is also know as The Dreyfuls Model and it has 5 stages</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Novice</li>
		<li>Advanced beginner</li>
		<li>Competent</li>
		<li>Proficient</li>
		<li>Expert Wizard</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This model helps us to understand that we all are in different stages, so "Do no treat everyone equal, while someone is a sheep other can be a racehorse" better indentify in which stage you are and in which other are your teammates in that way you will avoid herding racehorses or racing sheeps</p>

	<p>But how can we become a Wizard? this is easy, improve your knowledge, create a plan asking yourself Where are you going?, How will you get there?, How will you know you are on track? (You know you are right when you get there) and then invest at least 2 hours per week minimun to learn something new and training yourself</p>

	<p>Definitely working hard constantly is the only way of improve and become a Wizard</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Productivity</li>
		<li>Performance</li>
		<li>Reliability</li>
		<li>Portability</li>
		<li>Community</li>
		<li>What you alredy know</li>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Perfection-Is-Unrealistic-Linda-Rising/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Perfection Is An Unrealistic Goal:</a></strong><br>I have learned a few things about this talk:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Perfection Is An Unrealistic Goal</li>
		<li>We sleep in 90 minutes intervals (1.5hs so I should sleep 6 or 7.5hs)</li>
		<li>We do things in cycles and the optimized cycle of working is 90x20 minutes (20 for a break and 90 for focused working)</li>
		<li>Being productive means working smart, finding the best schedule for doing more things not for doing different things at the same time (multi-task)</li>
		<li>Do not check emails while coding or you are focused because it can double the time of doing some task (do not get distracted)</li>
		<li>Is so important having slides, in that way all the listeners can understands you better (in this video there was not slides)</li>
		<li>Create abstractions or histories for explainig things, this is an easier way of explaning</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/linda-rising-agile-bonobos/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Linda Rising on Collaboration, Bonobos and The Brain:</a></strong><br>There was an experiment about bonobos and chimpazees, they choose 2 set of monkeys (chimpazees and bonobos), they were isloated and then in the middle the left some amount of bannanas, the chimpazees group fight for being the alpha male and only the winner and him minions could eat bannanas, then theu do the same experiment with bonobos, but istead of fighting against each others, they started to have sex between them (male with male, male with females and so on), when they finished they distribute the bannanas equals for eveyone, well this is experiment has relevance because we are more similar to bonobos than chimpazees and because thnaks to this someone did an experiment but instead of sex use the pair programming, this dude divide all his team un pairs and let them work together for 1.5hrs then the partner A stop working and then Partener B start working, after 1.5hrs more, The parter A change chair with other partner A of other pair, then they do this with the B partners in every pair, so they start to rotate all the pairs, this give more satidfaction for programmers, reduce the amount of bugs and apparently was funny for all the participants<br>Take care of doing teams maximum of 10 participants, this is the best number for teams<br>Use your unconsicious for solving complex problems, so relax and take breaks, it is productive</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGHhCmdIvuI&ab_channel=GOTOConferences" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Who do You Trust? Beware of Your Brain • Linda Rising • GOTO 2016:</a></strong><br>We work under a label system it was given to us thanks to evlolution for surviving, but today this labels system make us change our behavior, imagine that your familly start to say that you are bad for drawing, if they continue saying this to you, you are going to start to balieve that you are not good at drawing even without having tried it, this happens every day with every one, so take care of what labels you use or even in what boxes you use, maybe you see a grey-haired old lady and then you start to treat her like a useless person, trust me, the old people do not like feeling useless, is the same for you, if someone older treat you like a complete idiot, you do not like to feel as an idiot right? so take care of what you do and what you say, take care of how you make feel to the people, because in the same way that you treat others they will treat you </p>

	<p><strong><a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Everything is a Remix:</a></strong><br>Everything is a Remix and create new ideas are made over other ideas that were already done<br>This phenomenon is so normal in the music ioudtry, at the begining fo hip-hop culturre, the DJ's create music usong other vynils and this was named samples, samples are in everywhere, in rap, pop and even in rock music, but this industry is not the oinly onde, the movies and cineme inspires theirself in other movies for doing new and more cooler movies, even they inspire in other types of art like books, theather or toys like transformers did<br>Genres are another examples, a sub genre is a different version of the original genere, like the genre horror and its subgenre supernatural horror<br>The conclusion is that Creativity is a mith, we have ideas based in other ideas, we copy, transform and then combine all those ideas to create more interisting stuff, is so difficul be 100% original</p>
