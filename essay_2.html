	<ul>
		<li>Firts things first "you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else" this means "you have to be a nice person with social skills"</li>
		
		<li> Do not be afriad of making mistakes, mistakes guide you to an oportunity for improving yourself, so go ahead and fail</li>
		
		<li>Do not be Territorial, touch others code and let them touch your code and in this same way lose your ego, ego contribute nothing but it makes the team work harder, so lose your ego</li>
		
		<li>Critics are good, be open to reviews, is the same like failing but with experimented comments and talking about experience</li>
		
		<li>Be the little fish, this means "you shuld be open to learn from everyone" if your are a little fish is more easy to grow up</li>
		
		<li>Encourage the people to do good things</li>
		
		<li>Document your failures</li>
		
		<li>Pay attention to your tools and your timing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you do all these things, people will think you are a genius</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Network / Load Time / Critial Path</li>
		<li>Render / Images / Videos / DOM</li>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqc418tQDkg&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The LZ77 Compression Family (Ep 2, Compressor Head):</a></strong><br>The Familly LZ77 and LZ78 is the actual lineage for compression algorithms, all this fammilly has some in common and it is tokenizer values that already exist in the stream for reducing the amount of click/bits that are needed for a less entrophy, this fammily has give us algorithms like 7ZIP, WINRAR, GZIP and others.</p>
