	<ul>
		<li>Firts things first "you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else" this means "you have to be a nice person with social skills"</li>
		
		<li> Do not be afriad of making mistakes, mistakes guide you to an oportunity for improving yourself, so go ahead and fail</li>
		
		<li>Do not be Territorial, touch others code and let them touch your code and in this same way lose your ego, ego contribute nothing but it makes the team work harder, so lose your ego</li>
		
		<li>Critics are good, be open to reviews, is the same like failing but with experimented comments and talking about experience</li>
		
		<li>Be the little fish, this means "you shuld be open to learn from everyone" if your are a little fish is more easy to grow up</li>
		
		<li>Encourage the people to do good things</li>
		
		<li>Document your failures</li>
		
		<li>Pay attention to your tools and your timing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you do all these things, people will think you are a genius</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Network / Load Time / Critial Path</li>
		<li>Render / Images / Videos / DOM</li>
		<li>Compute / JS code</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqc418tQDkg&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">The LZ77 Compression Family (Ep 2, Compressor Head):</a></strong><br>The Familly LZ77 and LZ78 is the actual lineage for compression algorithms, all this fammilly has some in common and it is tokenizer values that already exist in the stream for reducing the amount of click/bits that are needed for a less entrophy, this fammily has give us algorithms like 7ZIP, WINRAR, GZIP and others.</p>
	<p>Talks safe: spaces, agile, </p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05RFEGWNxts&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Markov Chain Compression (Ep 3, Compressor Head):</a></strong><br>There is another super hero in the compression history and is the "Markov chain", this is a probabilistic algorithm that use Variable Lenght Codes but with particularity of the next item or event that accurs next depends only by state attained in the previous event</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTCuYzAw31Y&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google I/O 2012 - The Art of Organizational Manipulation:</a></strong><br>The title of this video is tricky, it is no about how to manipulate an organization, this video is about how to learn to work with people in corporations, in this video explain the difference between and ideal or perfect working environment and the real life situations and I got surprised beacuse Encora has all the characteristics for a perfect environment e.g.:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Servant Leadership</li>
		<li>Pursue Responsability</li>
		<li>Questions things</li>
		<li>Act like and Adult</li>
		<li>Take risks and Expand comfort zone</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-7l8cnpI4k&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Google I/O 2011: Programming Well with Others - Social Skills for Geeks:</a></strong><br>Every developer wants to have the edgy technical knowledge but working in the software industry does not mean having only technical skills, think in your favorite open source project, this project was made only by one persone?, not right?, well working in the software industry means working with people so you need social skills or maybe something more siple like tips and in this video Brian and Ben explain that working with people is like working with a compiler, you do not write 10,000 lines of code and then is ready por production, you write some lines and then run the compiler and you get feedback to improve your software or add a new feature, so ask to your coworkers or teammates if you are doing somethinf good or not good, if you have a doubt of how to intreact with someone, ask him/her how to do it (run your social compiler), here ar another tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Perpetuate the respect: If you start working respectfully, it is going to be like this always, other wise if you start working angry or without respect, so you will continue working how!?</li>
		<li>Share your ideas: Communicate what you are doing and where you are going to, with your teamate because that way everyone will know if as Team you are working well or there is someone clueless</li>
		<li>If there is no manager, someone need to take the leadership</li>
		<li>Be responsible and comunicative</li>
		<li>Have the 3 keys of Knowledge industry:
			<ul>
				<li>Autonomy</li>
				<li>Mastery</li>
				<li>Purpose</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How to deal with a jerk?: Is valid to protect your culture but if you confront a toxic guy you will play his/her game, so the best options is not feeding with your energy that mosnter, instead just ignore and concentrate on doing your stuff</li>
		<li>Do no answer with violence to violence</li>
		<li>Is against the behavior not he person: There are such awesome developers that acts like a jerk, but this jerking atitude is a behavior, so try to "fight" against the actions or the behavior, not the person, instead of saying "your are a Jerk" is better say "your actions and your behavior only make others feel bad, stop treating us badly, you are here for doing software"</li>
		<li>You are here for doing software: This basically means do not be a jerk</li>
		<li>Recognize people when they are doing good thins</li>
		<li>Do no try to get credit for everything</li>
		<li>Build a reputation of trust: let people trust on you</li>
		<li>Learn to talk non techie</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas/" class="inside-links" target="_blank">Developing Expertise - Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep:</a></strong><br>This video starts with a powerful phrase "without excelent personnel, even good to excellent processes can only achieve marginal results", We have heard that theres is more to learn than just programming or technical skills, but in this video is about how to improve your hardskill with a softskill technique</p>
	<p>In our teams exist different types of persons but let's focus on two types, the wizards and the novices, wizards are mythological creatures that understand everything and fix everything, usually when you have a problem you ask crying to this dude how to fix it, and exist the novices, these are newbies and they need help and a detailed explanation for any task, the porpouse of this video is help to every developer in this journey of becoming from a novice into an expert wizard</p>

	<p>This journey is also know as The Dreyfuls Model and it has 5 stages</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Novice</li>
		<li>Advanced beginner</li>
		<li>Competent</li>
		<li>Proficient</li>
		<li>Expert Wizard</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This model helps us to understand that we all are in different stages, so "Do no treat everyone equal, while someone is a sheep other can be a racehorse" better indentify in which stage you are and in which other are your teammates in that way you will avoid herding racehorses or racing sheeps</p>

	<p>But how can we become a Wizard? this is easy, improve your knowledge, create a plan asking yourself Where are you going?, How will you get there?, How will you know you are on track? (You know you are right when you get there) and then invest at least 2 hours per week minimun to learn something new and training yourself</p>

	<p>Definitely working hard constantly is the only way of improve and become a Wizard</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Productivity</li>
		<li>Performance</li>
		<li>Reliability</li>
		<li>Portability</li>
		<li>Community</li>
		<li>What you alredy know</li>
